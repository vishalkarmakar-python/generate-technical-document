### 1. Object Header

- **Object Name:** zdmo_p_agency
- **Object Type:** ABAP Business Service Interface (BSI) for RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP)
- **High-Level Purpose:** The interface `zdmo_p_agency` is defined with the behavior `Agency`, which supports CREATE, UPDATE, and DELETE operations using the RESTful API. It utilizes ETag for optimistic concurrency control.

### 2. Detailed Description

The `zdmo_p_agency` interface serves as a RESTful API endpoint for managing agency data within the application. The behavior `Agency` is defined to handle CREATE, UPDATE, and DELETE operations on the Agency projection entity. This interface employs ETag for optimistic concurrency control, ensuring that multiple updates do not conflict with each other.

### 3. Interface Details

- **Parameters:** None (This BSI does not have any explicit parameters or selection screens.)

### 4. Core Processing Logic

1. Initialization: The interface is initialized upon receiving a request from the client.
2. Data Validation: The incoming data is validated to ensure it meets the required format and constraints.
3. Operation Execution: Depending on the HTTP method (POST, PUT, or DELETE), the standard Create, Update, or Delete operation is executed for the Agency projection entity.
4. Optimistic Concurrency Control: ETag is used to check if the data has been modified since it was last read, preventing potential conflicts during concurrent updates.
5. Response Generation: The appropriate HTTP status code and response are generated based on the outcome of the operation (success or failure).

### 5. Data Model and Dependencies

- **Database Interaction:** No explicit database interactions are performed within this BSI. However, it interacts with the Agency projection entity, which may involve SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations on underlying tables.
- **External Calls:** None (This BSI does not call any external function modules, class methods, or other objects explicitly.)

### 6. Assumptions and Prerequisites

- Assumes that the incoming request contains valid data for the Agency projection entity.
- Assumes that ETag is correctly implemented and functioning to ensure optimistic concurrency control.
